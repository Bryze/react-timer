## Usage
This is a very early build setup.

 Build and usage procedures might change in the coming future.

 ### Steps

 1. In the `package.json` file, change the following keys to 
 ```js
  "main": "example/src/dist/index.js",
  "module": "example/src/dist/index.es.js",
 ```
 2. In `example/src/App.js` change the import statement to: 
 ```js
 import ReactTimer from "./dist";
 ```
 3. Once, above two steps are completed, execute the following commands in two different terminals
 ```bash
  yarn && yarn start
 ```
 ```bash
 cd example && yarn && yarn start
 ```
 4. You should be able to see the library code in action!
